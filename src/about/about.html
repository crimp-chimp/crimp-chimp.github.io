        <p>
            My sister often quips that I'm granola, and honestly, it's fitting.
            My first love is Jesus, I climb occasionally, I take pictures less occasionally, people think I'm better at guitar than I actually am, and i speend more money than I ought to on local draft beers.
            If you look closeley, you can find me wandering Salt Lake City too: I still have yet to figure out the grid system.
            These days, while I try to stick to analog film (mostly 35mm), I still get chuffed about digital shots now and then.
            I have a love-hate relationship with pre-exposed film (which, as of writing this, is tending towards love).
